# OpenShift Demo Use Case

This repository contains a demo project showcasing how to build, deploy, and manage a microservices-based application on [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end use case—from local development to continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) on OpenShift.
